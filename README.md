CS639 Team 1's Project 2021

1. We want to create a way for people to shop faster and healthier. Usually caloric counters are in health apps where you have to input what you eat. Instead we want to make a food shopping app where this feature is integrated; This way when you are getting ingredients or food at the store you can make sure your meals are tailored for your diet.

3. Major features include: Caloric counter based on food data from API, shopping list with calorie counter built in, and diet options based on your weight goals.
