CS639 Team 1's Project 2021

1. We want to create a way for people to shop faster and healthier. Usually caloric counters are in health apps where you have to input what you eat. Instead we want to make a food shopping app where this feature is integrated; This way when you are getting ingredients or food at the store you can make sure your meals are tailored for your diet.

3. Major features include: Caloric counter based on food data from API, shopping list with calorie counter built in, and diet options based on your weight goals.

5. We will be using the ESHA Research Nutrition API portal. This API will give us information about each food item's nutritional information with a straightforward JSON format. Link: https://nutrition-api-dev.esha.com/
   We will also be using the Firebase database to collect and store information for the user such that the user can view their app on multiple devices at their convenience.
   Finally, we are planning to use a cache to store information locally on a phone such that we don't have to access the nutrition API too often.
